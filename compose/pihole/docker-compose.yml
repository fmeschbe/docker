#
# Debian has DNS stub on port 53 which must be disabled:
#
# sudo sed -r -i.orig 's/#?DNSStubListener=yes/DNSStubListener=no/g' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
#
#
# Also the resolv.conf file must be ensured to be dynamically linked to the dynamically
# generated one (typically, this is already the case):
#
# sudo sh -c 'rm /etc/resolv.conf && ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf'
#
# NOTE:
# This setup uses manual (explicit) IP address management as the Pi-Hole container must
# be configured to connected to the Unbound DNS container by stating the IP address as
# opposed to a domain name.
